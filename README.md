# HadoopTweetSentiment
    Data Loading: We loaded the Sentiment140 dataset, assumed to be in CSV format, into a PySpark DataFrame.

    Data Exploration: We checked the DataFrame's schema and displayed the first few rows of data to understand its structure and content.

    Statistical Analysis:

    a. Average Tweet Length: Calculated the average length of tweets in the dataset.

    b. Sentiment Distribution: Counted the number of positive and negative sentiment tweets and visualized their distribution using a bar chart.

    c. Sentiment by Date: Analyzed how sentiment changes over time by calculating the average sentiment for each day and visualizing it using a line plot.

    d. Average Tweet Length by Sentiment: Calculated the average tweet length separately for positive and negative sentiment tweets.

    e. Most Common Words: Identified the most frequently occurring words in positive and negative sentiment tweets.

    f. Sentiment by User: Analyzed how sentiment varies among different users by calculating the average sentiment for each user and visualizing it using a bar chart.

    Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib for data visualization to create bar charts and a line plot to represent sentiment distribution, sentiment by date, and sentiment by user.

These analyses and visualizations provided insights into sentiment trends, tweet characteristics, and user sentiment variations in the Sentiment140 dataset. You can further refine and expand these analyses based on your research objectives and data exploration requirements.
